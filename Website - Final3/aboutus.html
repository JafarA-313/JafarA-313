                        At PocketLab, we believe checking your health should be as easy as checking your phone. We're
                        creating simple, at-home screening tools to help Canadians catch nutrient deficiencies before
                        manageable symptoms turn into real medical concerns.
                        <br><br>We're so excited to introduce you to our first tool: The Iron Deficiency Kit™.
                        <br><br>Think of the first few people who come to mind, and chances are, at least one of them is
                        dealing with low iron. According to Health Canada, approximately 10.5% of Canadians are affected
                        by iron deficiency. This includes those who are often overlooked by traditional healthcare
                        systems, including rural and underserved communities, individuals with chronic diseases, and
                        vulnerable groups like women and children. Given that iron deficiency can cause persistent
                        fatigue, brain fog, and weakened immunity, the need for testing solutions that support timely
                        diagnosis and treatment is both real and pressing.
                        <br><br>Our semi-quantitative tests deliver quick, at-home insights from a simple finger prick,
                        helping you track changes and start important conversations with healthcare providers.
                        <br><br>No more chasing appointments.
                        <br><br>No more waiting rooms.
                        <br><br>Just quick results, whenever you need them.

                        <span class="bold">How can we improve access to care without adding strain to the system that
                            delivers it?</span>
                        <br>This question was the beginning of everything. Having worked in healthcare across various
                        settings, including specialist clinics, urgent care centers, and hospitals, I have observed and
                        challenged systemic barriers that compromise early care, often despite the best efforts of
                        healthcare providers. Between long wait times, multiple appointments, and limited follow-up, the
                        path to care becomes a maze. People try to move forward but end up stuck without any clear
                        direction.
                        <br><br>At a health innovation conference in Amsterdam, I observed how at-home diagnostic tools
                        were being used to bridge healthcare gaps. These tools made it easier for people to take
                        informed action, without depending solely on overburdened systems. The potential for applying a
                        similar model within Canada was immediately obvious. PocketLab started when I approached my
                        younger brother and his engineering friends and asked, “What if we actually tried to fix this?”
                        They were instrumental in building PocketLab from the ground up, especially since I only
                        recently discovered breadboards aren't for sandwiches, and I'm still not totally clear on what a
                        cookie is.
                        <br><br>Our mission is not only to make testing more accessible, but also to improve health
                        literacy. When people understand what they are testing for, why it matters, and what to do next,
                        they are better equipped to take charge of their well-being. We design our tools with
                        convenience, accuracy, and reliability in mind. Everything we build is created in collaboration
                        with healthcare providers based on the latest clinical guidelines and evidence-based thresholds.
                        <br><br>Although we cannot fix the system overnight, we can begin to eliminate the barriers to
                        healthcare access, one test kit at a time. Whether you are a patient, a provider, a caregiver,
                        or someone who simply believes in a better way forward, we invite you to be part of the
                        solution. No lab coat required!
